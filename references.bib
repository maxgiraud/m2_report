  abstract = {The present article carries out a review of MIMO-based techniques
	that have been recently proposed for satellite communications. Due
	to the plethora of MIMO interpretations in terrestrial systems and
	the particularities of satellite communications, this review is built
	on two pillars, namely fixed satellite and mobile satellite. Special
	attention is given to the characteristics of the satellite channel,
	which will ultimately determine the viability of MIMO over satellite.
	Finally, some future research directions are identified.},
