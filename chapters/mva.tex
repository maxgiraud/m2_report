%\section{Boosted Decision Tree}

Now that we get background and signal samples we can perform the MVA for classification.\\
For this work the TMVA framework from ROOT was used. Multiple MVA were tested (fig. \ref{mva_multiple}) with default configuration then the 2
bests were selected for the tuning of their parameters.\\
