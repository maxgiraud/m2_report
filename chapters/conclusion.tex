Hadronic jets are complex objects but also invaluable probes for the QCD and the proton structure.\\
To perform study of them a first step is to measure their energy, for this purpose a kind of interesting events are \textgamma+jet ones.
Indeed the photon energy counterbalance the jet energy because the total energy in the transverse plane is equal to zero.
But this kind of events is usually accompanied with a lot of multijet events (rich in photons), these are hard to discriminate from \textgamma+jet events\\
In this paper we used the full dataset collected by CMS in 2016 for proton-proton collisions.
With these data were implemented two multivariate analysis methods to identify prompt photons.\\
First we have defined a background-enriched control region on the real data.
It has been used for the training of the MVA as background sample and Monte-Carlo simultaion was used for the signal sample.
A boosted decision tree and an artificial neural network were trained with these samples, their output were fitted on the data with a maximum-likelihood method.\\
Finally the \textgamma+jet events purity were extracted from these fits.
